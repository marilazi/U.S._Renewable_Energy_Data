# U.S._Renewable_Energy_Data
This dataset contains detailed information about renewable energy production in various sectors from 2010 to 2023. The data has been aggregated and cleaned to focus on key renewable energy categories. It is suitable for creating visualizations, performing analysis, and monitoring trends in renewable energy contributions over time.

# üìÑ Dataset Description

# Columns
Year: The calendar year of energy production.
Solar Energy: Annual energy production from solar sources (in applicable units).
Wind Energy: Annual energy production from wind sources.
Biomass Energy: Energy produced from organic materials (e.g., wood, waste).
Hydroelectric Power: Total electricity produced by water-powered generators.
Geothermal Energy: Energy production derived from Earth's heat.
Wood Energy: Specific contribution of wood as a biomass energy source.
Total Renewable Energy: Sum of all renewable energy production sources combined.
Conventional Hydroelectric Power: Subset of hydroelectric power from conventional methods.
Biodiesel: Renewable energy production from biodiesel fuel.

# Features
Data is aggregated by year, allowing for trend analysis across renewable energy categories.
Includes energy production data for major renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectricity.
Cleaned and formatted for ease of visualization in tools such as Google Looker and Excel.
Data are in BTU or British Thermal Units in Trillions

# Source
The data originates from public and proprietary sources related to energy production statistics. It has been processed to remove redundant or irrelevant fields, focusing on renewable energy categories.
